To create a render pass that runs a compute shader, use the render graph system.

| Page | Description |
|-|-|
| [Run a compute shader in a render pass](render-graph-compute-shader-run.md) | Create a render pass that allocates a buffer and runs a compute shader to output data into the buffer. |
| [Create input data for a compute shader](render-graph-compute-shader-input.md) | Allocate a buffer that provides input data for a compute shader in a render pass. |
