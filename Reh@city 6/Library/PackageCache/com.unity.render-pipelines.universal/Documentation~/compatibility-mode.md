## Compatibility Mode

If you enable **Compatibility Mode (Render Graph Disabled)** in URP graphics settings, you can write a Scriptable Render Pass without using the [render graph API](render-graph.md). The setting is in **Project Settings** > **Graphics** > **Pipeline Specific Settings** > **URP** > **Render Graph**.

> [!NOTE]
> Unity no longer develops or improves the rendering path that doesn't use the [render graph API](render-graph.md). Use the render graph API instead when developing new graphics features.
