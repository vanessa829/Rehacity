> [!NOTE]
> Unity no longer develops or improves the rendering path that doesn't use the [render graph API](render-graph.md). Use the render graph API instead when developing new graphics features. To use the instructions on this page, enable **Compatibility Mode (Render Graph Disabled)** in URP graphics settings (**Project Settings** > **Graphics**).
