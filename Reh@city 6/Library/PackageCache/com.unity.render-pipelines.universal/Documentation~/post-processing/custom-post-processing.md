# Custom post-processing

The Universal Render Pipeline (URP) provides a variety of pre-built [post-processing effects](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@15.0/manual/integration-with-post-processing.html) that you can adjust to create a particular visual effect or style. URP also lets you create custom post-processing effects.

The following page describe different approaches to creating custom post-processing effects.
