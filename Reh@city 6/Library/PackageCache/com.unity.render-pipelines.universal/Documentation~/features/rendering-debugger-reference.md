## Display Stats

The **Display Stats** panel shows statistics relevant to debugging performance issues in your project. You can only view this section of the Rendering Debugger in Play Mode. Refer to [Open the Rendering Debugger](rendering-debugger-use.md#control-the-overlay) for more information. 

### <a name="frame-stats"></a>Frame Stats

The Frame Stats section displays the average, minimum, and maximum value of each property. URP calculates each Frame Stat value over the 30 most recent frames.

| **Property**                 | **Description**                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Frame Rate**               | The frame rate (in frames per second) for the current camera view. |
| **Frame Time**               | The total frame time for the current camera view.            |
| **CPU Main Thread Frame**    | The total time (in milliseconds) between the start of the frame and the time when the Main Thread finished the job. |
| **CPU  Render Thread Frame** | The time (in milliseconds) between the start of the work on the Render Thread and the time Unity waits to render the present frame ([Gfx.PresentFrame](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.1/Documentation/Manual/profiler-markers.html)). |
| **CPU Present Wait**         | The time (in milliseconds) that the CPU spent waiting for Unity to render the present frame ([Gfx.PresentFrame](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.1/Documentation/Manual/profiler-markers.html)) during the last frame. |
| **GPU Frame**                | The amount of time (in milliseconds) the GPU takes to render a given frame. |

<a name="bottlenecks"></a>

### Bottlenecks

A bottleneck is a condition that occurs when one process performs significantly slower than other components, and other components depend on it. 

The **Bottlenecks** section describes the distribution of the last 60 frames across the CPU and GPU. You can only check the Bottleneck information when you build your player on a device. 

**Note**: Vsync limits the **Frame Rate** based on the refresh rate of your deviceâ€™s screen. This means when you enable Vsync, the **Present Limited** category is 100% in most cases. To turn Vsync off, go to **Edit** > **Project settings** > **Quality** > **Current Active Quality Level** and set the **Vsync Count** set to **Don't Sync**.

#### Bottleneck categories

| **Category**        | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **CPU**             | The percentage of the last 60 frames in which the CPU limited the frame time. |
| **GPU**             | The percentage of the last 60 frames in which the GPU limited the frame time. |
| **Present limited** | The percentage of the last 60 frames in which the frame time was limited by the following presentation constraints:<br>&bull; Vertical Sync (Vsync): Vsync synchronizes rendering to the refresh rate of your display.<br>&bull;[Target framerate]([Application.targetFrameRate](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-targetFrameRate.html)): A function that you can use to manually limit the frame rate of an application. If a frame is ready before the time you specify in targetFrameRate, Unity waits before presenting the frame. |
| **Balanced**        | This percentage of the last 60 frames in which the frame time was not limited by any of the above categories. A frame that is 100% balanced indicates the processing time for both CPU and GPU is approximately equal. |

#### Bottleneck example

If Vsync limited 20 of the 60 most recent frames, the Bottleneck section might appear as follows: 

- **CPU** 0.0%: This indicates that URP did not render any of the last 60 frames on the CPU.
- **GPU** 66.6%: This indicates that the GPU limited 66.6% of the 60 most recent frames rendered by URP.
- **Present Limited** 33.3%: This indicates that presentation constraints (Vsync or the [target framerate](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-targetFrameRate.html)) limited 33.3% of the last 60 frames.
- **Balanced** 0.0%: This indicates that in the last 60 frames, there were 0 frames where the CPU processing time and GPU processing time were the same.

In this example, the bottleneck is the GPU.

<a name="detailed-stats"></a>

### Detailed Stats

The Detailed Stats section displays the amount of time in milliseconds that each rendering step takes on the CPU and GPU. URP updates these values once every frame based on the previous frame. 

| **Property**                     | **Description**                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Update every second with average | Calculate average values over one second and update every second. |
| Hide empty scopes                | Hide profiling scopes that use 0.00ms of processing time on the CPU and GPU. |
| Debug XR Layout                  | Enable to display debug information for [XR](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/XR.html) passes. This mode only appears in the editor and development builds. |

## Frequently Used

This section contains a selection of properties that users use often. The properties are from the other sections in the Rendering Debugger window. For information about the properties, refer to the sections [Material](#material), [Lighting](#lighting), and [Rendering](#rendering).


## Rendering

The properties in this section let you visualize different rendering features.

### Rendering Debug

| **Property**                   | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Map Overlays**               | Specifies which render pipeline texture to overlay on the screen. The options are:<ul><li>**None**: Renders the scene normally without a texture overlay.</li><li>**Depth**: Overlays the camera's depth texture on the screen.</li><li>**Additional Lights Shadow Map**: Overlays the [shadow map](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/shadow-mapping.html) that contains shadows cast by lights other than the main directional light.</li><li>**Main Light Shadow Map**: Overlays the shadow map that contains shadows cast by the main directional light.</li></ul> |
| **&nbsp;&nbsp;Map Size**       | The width and height of the overlay texture as a percentage of the view window URP displays it in. For example, a value of **50** fills up a quarter of the screen (50% of the width and 50% of the height). |
| **HDR**                        | Indicates whether to use [high dynamic range (HDR)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/HDR.html) to render the scene. Enabling this property only has an effect if you enable **HDR** in your URP Asset. |
| **MSAA**                       | Indicates whether to use [Multisample Anti-aliasing (MSAA)](./../anti-aliasing.md#msaa) to render the scene. Enabling this property only has an effect if:<ul><li>You set **Anti Aliasing (MSAA)** to a value other than **Disabled** in your URP Asset.</li><li>You use the Game View. MSAA has no effect in the Scene View.</li></ul> |
| **Post-processing**            | Specifies how URP applies post-processing. The options are:<ul><li>**Disabled**: Disables post-processing.</li><li>**Auto**: Unity enables or disables post-processing depending on the currently active debug modes. If color changes from post-processing would change the meaning of a debug mode's pixel, Unity disables post-processing. If no debug modes are active, or if color changes from post-processing don't change the meaning of the active debug modes' pixels, Unity enables post-processing.</li><li>**Enabled**: Applies post-processing to the image that the camera captures.</li></ul> |
| **Additional Wireframe Modes** | Specifies whether and how to render wireframes for meshes in your scene. The options are:<ul><li>**None**: Doesn't render wireframes.</li><li>**Wireframe**: Exclusively renders edges for meshes in your scene. In this mode, you can see the wireframe for meshes through the wireframe for closer meshes.</li><li>**Solid Wireframe**: Exclusively renders edges and faces for meshes in your scene. In this mode, the faces of each wireframe mesh hide edges behind them.</li><li>**Shaded Wireframe**: Renders edges for meshes as an overlay. In this mode, Unity renders the scene in color and overlays the wireframe over the top.</li></ul> |
| **Overdraw**                   | Indicates whether to render the overdraw debug view. This is useful to check where Unity draws pixels over one other. |

#### Mipmap Streaming

| **Property** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| **Disable Mip Caching** | If you enable **Disable Mip Caching**, Unity doesn't cache mipmap levels in GPU memory, and constantly discards mipmap levels from GPU memory when they're no longer needed. This means the mipmap streaming debug views more accurately display which mipmap levels Unity uses at the current time. Enabling this setting increases the amount of data Unity transfers from disk to the CPU and the GPU. |
| **Debug View** | Set a mipmap streaming debug view. Options:<ul><li>**None**: Display the normal view.</li><li>**Mip Streaming Performance**: Use color to indicate which textures use mipmap streaming, and whether mipmap streaming limits the number of mipmap levels Unity loads.</li><li>**Mip Streaming Status**: Use color on materials to indicate whether their textures use mipmap streaming. Diagonal stripes mean some of the textures use a [`requestedMipmapLevel`](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Texture2D-requestedMipmapLevel.html) that overrides mipmap streaming. Yellow means Unity can't stream the texture, or the texture is assigned to terrain.</li><li>**Mip Streaming Activity**: Use color to indicate whether Unity recently streamed the textures.</li><li>**Mip Streaming Priority**: Use color to indicate the streaming priority of the textures. Set streaming priority for a texture in the [**Texture Import Settings** window](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-TextureImporter.html).</li><li>**Mip Count**: Display the number of mipmap levels Unity loads for the textures.</li><li>**Mip Ratio**: Use color to indicate the pixel density of the highest-resolution mipmap levels Unity uploads for the textures.</li></ul> |
| **Debug Opacity** | Set the opacity of the **Debug View** you select. 0 means not visible and 1 means fully visible. This property is visible only if **Debug View** is not set to **None**. |
| **Combined Per Material** | Set the **Debug View** to display debug information of all the textures on a material, not individual texture slots. This property is only visible if **Debug View** is set to **Mip Streaming Status** or **Mip Streaming Activity**. |
| **Material Texture Slot** | Set which texture Unity uses from each material to display debug information. For example, set **Material Texture Slot** to **Slot 3** to display debug information for the fourth texture. If a material has fewer textures than the **Material Texture Slot** value, Unity uses no texture. This property is visible only if **Combined Per Material** is disabled, and **Debug View** is not set to **None**. |
| **Display Status Codes** | Display more detailed statuses for textures that display as **Not streaming** or **Warning** in the **Mip Streaming Status** debug view. This property is visible only if **Debug View** is set to **Mip Streaming Status**. |
| **Activity Timespan** | Set how long a texture displays as **Just streamed**, in seconds. This property is visible only if **Debug View** is set to **Mip Streaming Activity**. |
| **Terrain Texture** | Set which terrain texture Unity displays. You can select either **Control** for the control texture, or one of the diffuse textures. This property is visible only if **Debug View** is not set to **None**. |

| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pixel Validation Mode**        | Specifies which mode Unity uses to validate pixel color values. The options are:<ul><li>**None**: Renders the scene normally and doesn't validate any pixels.</li><li>**Highlight NaN, Inf and Negative Values**: Highlights pixels that have color values that are NaN, Inf, or negative.</li><li>**Highlight Values Outside Range**: Highlights pixels that have color values outside a particular range. Use **Value Range Min** and **Value Range Max**.</li></ul> |
| **&nbsp;&nbsp;Channels**         | Specifies which value to use for the pixel value range validation. The options are:<ul><li>**RGB**: Validates the pixel using the luminance value calculated from the red, green, and blue color channels.</li><li>**R**: Validates the pixel using the value from the red color channel.</li><li>**G**: Validates the pixel using the value from the green color channel.</li><li>**B**: Validates the pixel using the value from the blue color channel.</li><li>**A**: Validates the pixel using the value from the alpha channel.</li></ul>This property only appears if you set **Pixel Validation Mode** to **Highlight Values Outside Range**. |
| **&nbsp;&nbsp; Value Range Min** | The minimum valid color value. Unity highlights color values that are less than this value.<br/><br/>This property only appears if you set **Pixel Validation Mode** to **Highlight Values Outside Range**. |
| **&nbsp;&nbsp; Value Range Max** | The maximum valid color value. Unity highlights color values that are greater than this value.<br/><br/>This property only appears if you set **Pixel Validation Mode** to **Highlight Values Outside Range**. |
